This repository exists because [thephpleague/flysystem-azure](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-azure) has some issue with [Azure/azure-storage-php](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-php) version.

I will fork and commit a PR to [thephpleague/flysystem-azure](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-azure) if I have that time. 

@see [thephpleague/flysystem-azure](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-azure)
